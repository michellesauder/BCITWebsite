                <p>For most people, learning to code cannot be rushed. Consider the Software System Developer (SSD) program for a proper coding education with enough time to actually learn the content. Study at an institution that is recognized and trusted by industry throughout Western Canada. Over 80% of SSD graduates are hired as web application developers. </p>
                
                <p>The SSD Web Programmer option is an eight-month, full-time web application development program offered at BCIT's the downtown Vancouver campus. </p>
                                
                <p>SSD prepares individuals for high-demand careers in the technical areas of web application development. Train for a new career through extensive hands-on practice. </p>

                <p>Graduates of this certificate program may apply for acceptance into the BCIT Bachelor of Technology in Computer Systems (additional prerequisites are required). Laddering into the Computer Systems Technology Diploma program is not an option. </p>
                <p>This program is delivered through classroom instruction, hands-on lab work and individual and team projects. 

                    While applicants are not required to have formal computer programming experience, they need to have a solid understanding of object-oriented programming. Applicants with no knowledge are advised to take a programming language course, such as introduction to object-oriented programming, C#, or Java. Speak with us today so we can help you prepare to join us. </p>
